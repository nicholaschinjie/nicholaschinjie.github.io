<a href="https://github.com/FoodLeaguePlus/Swipe">SwipeRightNetworking</a> was an idea conceived over the 24 hours at <a href="https://www.hackathon.com/event/bizhacks-2019-52451551001"> BizHacks 2019</a>. It would be great to have a searchable, social way for me to connect with employees with skills I need. With a team of four other developers and data scienists, we built a <a href="https://tinder.com/?lang=en">Tinder</a>-style app for browsing employee profiles. When employees **swipe right** on each other, it's a match! 

The app was built using Swift, and we developed our own machine learning recommendation algorithm in R. It's a fun, familiar, social, interface for any employee to find the perfect match for their next coffee chat. 

**Disclaimer**: My first time working with Swift and it shows.
