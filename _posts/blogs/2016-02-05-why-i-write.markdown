I've wanted to start blogging since 16, never dared publish publicly. 
Why is it worth reading? Leaving me vulnerable. I prefer to think of humans as a black box.
Why would I be considered a role-model where there are much more brilliant people out there?

Then I realized, I'm on my own level, one person stumbling upon my blog helps them, I'd consider it a job well done. 
I'm not high IQ brilliant insane super mode
It's about sharing a story, and learning from it Reflecting 

Learning from Rob - someone I look up to, constantly want to learn from his experiences
- how do you get to a point where you become so insane
- now that I'm actually closer to it, I want to share my own experiences and how I got there

How I got to this point, and how I aim to get better

Writing about the experience invisible to outsiders, 

Practice my writing

With technical blogs, sometimes it's not so much about the product and more about the process. 

I don't need a consistent user base. If any one of my posts inspires or educates someone about applying, or motivates them, then it's worth it. 

It demonstrates commitment 
- concrete evidence that I live and breathe tech and want to become better
- to friends who are interested / grow up with 
- for recruiters to learn about me (my specializations)
- for strangers who stumbled upon a cogs student who made it
