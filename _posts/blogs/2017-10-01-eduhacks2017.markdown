I've never been accused of substance abuse. Unless you'd consider hundred milligrams worth of caffeine doused in one's bloodstream a form of overdose.

A feeling of such high is difficult to come by. Yet is one that perfectly describes my experience at Eduhacks 2017; the first of many 24-hour hackathons I would attend during my time as an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia. In retrospect, it's difficult to justify why I'd choose to spend my weekends holed up indoors, despite being situated in the heart of bright and beautiful British Columbia. This event being my first, I certainly wasn't expecting to win anything. What ultimately convinced me was the prospect of gaining experience outside the classroom. Plus, I really wanted to add to my laptop sticker collection.

However, due to a mixture of ineffective communication and bad 'economic' planning, the team-of-five I assembled beforehand never showed up. No longer protected by the in-group homogeneity bubble, I was wrought with uncertainty. Being surrounded by far more experienced hackers in filled teams and ready-made ideas left me more vulnerable to imposter syndrome than ever. Metaphorically, in this instance the ground beneath my feet began to sink, and **there began my descent down the rabbit hole**.

### Team Building Without Autofill Parity

The first hour of the plunge down is typically defined by inexperience. In my case, that inexperience perfectly partnered my underqualifications. I came from a background satiated with individual competition designed to bring the most out of every person. Competing in inter-state badminton competitions made me understand that in some cases you are the better player and in some cases your opponent is just stronger.

What I wish I knew at the time was at a hackathon - **learning** is it's very core activity. Competition will always be binary. But for more than 24 hours, we have the chance to teach others what has been taught to us, and for the more experienced to provide a helping hand to those of us in need of one. Hackathons are breeding grounds for talented people of diverse backgrounds. And even though the process of working with strangers instead of friends may be initially daunting, it presents a rare opportunity. Even if you don't know how to code - you get to participate in a dialougue where initially alien concepts, new programming languages, and courtesy is shared and practiced. For me, the wonders of the development process is exemplified by conversation and honest feedback - by some of the most talented people I've had the pleasure of working with.

It just so happened, on that fateful day, I was introduced to four of them - an educator, an artist, two developers. Armed with a melting pot of ideas, it was go time. 


### To Hack A Product

Blessed to have an idea. But panic mode - 6 hrs in we still didn't have anything. 

<!-- 

But in the moment, ain't got no time for games, CODE AND FIGURE IT OUT NOW! 

It's
It forced me out of my comfort zone; daunted by the expansive horizons, and what I know now is insignificant to how much there is out there. (no matter how many times I attend hackathons and grow, there's always still something I don't know)
Nor should the process be conditional; no matter one's level of experience, there are always things that can be learnt by speaking to others.

The solution: next part = working on it

## Learn fast or die slow 

the dopamine 

## Learn from where?

## Expecting to win (skills =/= ideas)

## The thing about rabbit holes
- what is a rabbit hole
- why did I go down the rabbit hole
- winning was nice, but over the countless hackathons I've learnt: perserverence, you can always be better, you win you lose, can be a waste of time if you're not careful. But it's about putting yourself out there and doing all of the above (learning, inspiring, developing, networking) 
- SHOW ALL OTHER HACKATHONS YOU DIDN'T WIN BUT HAD FUN (YOU GROW IN EACH ONE)

- meeting people, absorbing so much (knowledge transfer), recruiters, mentorship 

- How do people know so much. Where do they learn all this? (not in the classroom, through sheer effort, willpower, and late nights)
- The rabbit hole I refer to is the time spent and madness dedicated to figure out problems, stick with code. Not just get good at algorithms and class stuff, learn to use libraries, frameworks. Self taught
- The need to know, the desire to succeed
- The never ending learning cycle 

- Realistic expectaions - the rush of winning is rare (idea x skills) - winning ideas, no matter how good a developer you are 

- The thing about rabbit holes https://hackernoon.com/the-thing-about-rabbit-holes-201402f77873 

- And no matter how much you learn. There's always more. The constant learning cycle is essential to staying viable.

Now the world of industry is a complete different beast, but as long as you approach things with the same growth-mindset and a continuous desire to learn (as described in this blog), you're all good to go.  -->
