At my internship with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hsbc.ca/"> HSBC</a>, I worked primarily on Spring-cloud-based API development using Java microservices. Some of my notable contributions include building software that handled online credit card applications, customer background verification, and implementing OpenID 2.0-based security logic.

Write-up is in my backlog of things to do next - it's item 221 in the queue.
