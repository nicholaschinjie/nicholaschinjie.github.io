In the summer of 2016, I undertook an eight-week internship with the cybersecurity division at Gamuda Berhad. On my first day, I was handed a laptop next to a pendrive containing a <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> bootable ISO image. Having just completed my first year of university, my work initially involved leveraging tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nslookup">"nslookup"</a> to perform simple IP scanning and discovery. Later, I got to work with more advanced tools such as <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit">SET</a> and <a href="https://getgophish.com/">Gophish</a> to carry out company-wide social engineering attacks for security awareness training. My main responsibilities included:

-   Shadowing and assisting my supervisor in performing regular **security monitoring and maintaience** on workstations operating under the company's internal network
-   Conducting a **month-long phishing attack on employee email channels** using <a href="https://getgophish.com/">Gophish</a>, as part of a company IT security exercise to raise cybersecurity awareness

For the most part, I played a supporting role as an intern; given this was my first internship, and I knew virtually next to nothing). Interestingly, my work term coincided with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">global ransomware virus cyberattacks</a> at the beginning of May 2017, which upped the sense of significance and urgency at which I carried out my tasks. While this internship certainly did not make me Hackerman, the networking concepts I picked up proved useful down the line.
