In the summer of 2016, I undertook a eight-week internship with the cybersecurity division at Gamuda Berhad. On my first day, I was handed a laptop together with a pendrive containing a <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> bootable ISO image. Having just complete my first year of university, my work initially involved leveraging tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nslookup">"nslookup"</a> to perform simple IP scanning and discovery. Later, I got to work with more advanced tools such as <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://getgophish.com/">Gophish</a> to carry out company-wide social engineering attacks for security awareness training.

-   Shadowed and assisted my supervisor in performing regular security monitoring and maintaience on workstations operating under the company's internal network
-   Conducted a month-long phishing attack on employee email channels using <a href="https://getgophish.com/">Gophish</a>, as part of a company IT security exercise to raise cybersecurity awareness.

For the most part, I played a supporting role as an intern (given this was my first internship and I knew virtually next to nothing). Interestingly, my work term coincided with the global ransomware virus cyberattacks at the beginning of May 2017, which increased the sense of significance and urgency at which I carried out my tasks.
